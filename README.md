# GR8-project
For this project we created a rough simple used textbook marketplace for CU students. Using html, js, PHP, CSS, and mysql 
the gr8project folder lies in my local machines XAMPP "htdocs" folder and runs smootly locally, correctly adds books 
into the mysql database table. The search feautre functions and returns the correct books but the display is a bit rough 
looking but functional.
